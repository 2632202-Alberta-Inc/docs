## Product Categories
Represents categories of products commonly used in the oil and gas industry, including **Natural Gas Liquids (NGLs)** and various types of **Crude Oil.**

### Natural Gas Liquids (NGLs) `Category`
Natural Gas Liquids (NGLs) are hydrocarbons separated from natural gas during processing. They are used as fuels, petrochemical feedstocks, and blending agents in crude oil to adjust viscosity for transportation.

- **C1 (Methane)** `Product`: The main component of natural gas, used as a fuel for heating, electricity generation, and as a feedstock in chemical processes.
- **C2 (Ethane)** `Product`: Mainly used in petrochemical industries to produce ethylene, a key component in plastics and other products.
- **C3 (Propane)** `Product`: Used for heating, cooking, and as a fuel for vehicles. Propane is also a key component in petrochemical industries and as part of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).
- **C4 (Butane)** `Product`: Butane is used in gasoline blending, as a component of LPG, and in petrochemical applications.
- **C5 (Pentane)** `Product`: Found in natural gasoline, pentane is commonly used as a blending agent in crude oil or in petrochemical processes. It is also referred to as natural gasoline.

### Crude Oil
Crude oil is unrefined petroleum extracted from the ground, and it can vary significantly in its physical properties. The classification of crude oil typically depends on two factors:
1. **Light vs Heavy**: Light crude has a lower density and flows more easily than heavy crude. It requires less refining and is more valuable.
2. **Sweet vs Sour**: Sweet crude has a low sulfur content (less than 0.5%), while sour crude has a higher sulfur content. Sweet crudes are easier to refine and produce higher-value products, while sour crudes need additional processing to remove sulfur.

### Light Crude `Category`
Light crude oil has a lower density and is easier to refine. It flows more easily than heavier crudes and produces high-value products like gasoline and diesel.

- **West Texas Intermediate (WTI)** `Product`: A major benchmark for North American crude oil, produced in Texas and primarily in the Permian Basin. **WTI** is **light** and **sweet**, meaning it has low sulfur content and is highly desirable for refining.
- **BRN (Brent Crude Oil)** `Product`: A globally recognized benchmark crude produced in the North Sea. It is **light** and **sweet** with low sulfur content, making it easier and cheaper to refine.
- **LSB (Light Sweet Blend)** `Product`: A **light**, **low-sulfur** crude oil blend, often sourced from North America. It is highly valuable for producing gasoline.

### Medium Crude `Category`
Medium crude oils fall between light and heavy crudes. They tend to have moderate sulfur content and are more difficult to refine than light crude.

- **MSW (Mixed Sweet Blend)** `Product`: A **light-to-medium**, **sweet** crude oil blend produced mainly in Western Canada. Its moderate sulfur content makes it suitable for refining into gasoline and diesel.
- **MID (Midland Crude)** `Product`: Refers to **WTI Midland**, a medium to light crude from the Permian Basin. It is priced based on the WTI benchmark and is desirable for refining.

### Heavy Crude `Category`
Heavy crude oils are dense and more viscous compared to lighter crudes. They require more complex refining processes to produce lighter products like gasoline.

- **WCS (Western Canadian Select)** `Product`: A **heavy**, **sour** blend of crude oil produced in Alberta, Canada. It requires more processing due to its high sulfur content and density.
- **MSY (Mars Crude)** `Product`: A **medium** to **heavy**, **sour** crude oil produced in the Gulf of Mexico. Its higher sulfur content means more refining steps are required.

### Synthetic Crude `Category`
Synthetic crude oils are produced by upgrading heavy oil or bitumen (from oil sands). These are refined to be more similar to light crude oils and can be used as a substitute for conventional crude.

- **PSO (Premium Synthetic Oil)** `Product`: A type of **synthetic crude oil** produced by upgrading bitumen from oil sands. **PSO** is **light** and **sweet**, often used as a high-quality substitute for conventional crude oil.

### Byproducts `Category`
These are products or byproducts that need to be treated or removed during the oil extraction and refining processes.

- **Sulfur** `Product`: A byproduct of refining sour crude oil. Sulfur is removed during refining and can be used in fertilizer production.
- **Petroleum Coke (Petcoke)** `Product`: A carbon-rich byproduct from refining heavy crude oil. Petcoke is used as a fuel in industrial processes.
- **Sludge** `Product`: A mixture of hydrocarbons, water, and sediments that accumulate in storage tanks and pipelines during production and refining.
- **Asphaltenes** `Product`: Heavy components in crude oil that can precipitate during refining. They are often considered waste but can be used in asphalt production.
- **Produced Sand/Solids** `Product`: Sand and other solids produced along with hydrocarbons. These solids must be removed and disposed of.
- **Carbon Dioxide (CO2)** `Product`: Produced during oil and gas extraction. Captured CO2 can be used for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) or stored through carbon capture.
- **Hydrogen Sulfide (H2S)** `Product`: A toxic gas found in sour gas and sour crude oil. It is removed during processing and often converted into sulfur.
- **Emulsion** `Product`: A mixture of crude oil and water that forms during production. Emulsions must be separated before refining to ensure only pure crude oil is processed.
- **Water** `Product`: Produced water is water that is brought to the surface during oil and gas extraction. It must be managed, treated, or disposed of properly.
