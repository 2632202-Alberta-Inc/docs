## Endpoint

To start working with the API, youâ€™ll first need to know the base server endpoint that all requests should be directed to:

```
https://v1.api.flux-os.com
```

## Authentication

To authenticate your API requests, the Flux OS API requires two headers: `x-api-key` and `x-user-id`. You can generate your keys in the [app settings](https://dashboard.flux-os.com/settings) view in your dashboard.

## Example Request

Here is a sample Python request using the `requests` library:

```python
import requests

base_url = "https://v1.api.flux-os.com"
path = "/ping"

headers = {
    "x-api-key": "YOUR_API_KEY",
    "x-user-id": "YOUR_USER_ID"
}

response = requests.get(base_url + path, headers=headers)

print(response.status_code)
print(response.json())
```

We also offer multiple [SDKs](https://docs.flux-os.com/sdks). to interact with the API. Our easy-to-use libraries help to integrate with the API more efficiently.

Additionally, to see all available API endpoints, refer to our comprehensive [ documentation and API playground](https://docs.flux-os.com/api-reference).
