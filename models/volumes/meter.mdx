## Overview

A meter ticket represents continuous flow measurement data at a facility, including location details, measurements, and quality data.

## Attributes

### Identification

<ResponseField name="ID" required>
  The primary key idenitifier used inside the Flux system, unique across all
  organizations.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="External ID" required>
  The internal idenitifier used inside the organization
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Status" required>
  Status of the ticket in the Flux system
</ResponseField>

### Locations & Entities

<ResponseField name="Commercial Facility" required>
  Commercial facility where product is transferred (references `id` in
  CommercialFacility model)
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Commercial Entity" required>
  Entity that is transferring custody of the product (references `id` in Entity
  model)
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Facility Operator" required>
  Entity that operates the facility (references `id` in Entity model)
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Facility" required>
  Each ID references the `id` field in their respective models and only one
  should be specified: Battery, Terminal, Plant, Station, System, Pipeline, and
  Resource
</ResponseField>

<Info>
  Commercial facilities allow organizations to combine multiple facilities into
  meaningful business units for marketing, stakeholder reporting, internal
  tracking purposes, etc.
</Info>

<Info>
  Each facility is unique by their `regulator_id` (e.g. ABBT0030001),
  `jurisdiction` (e.g. Alberta), and `regulator_system` (e.g. Petrinex).
</Info>

### Timing

<ResponseField name="Production Date" required>
  Calendar day of the reported volume
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Start" required>
  Start time of ticket
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="End" required>
  End time of ticket
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Created At">
  Timestamp of when the ticket was created in Flux
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Updated At">
  Timestamp of when the ticket was last updated in Flux
</ResponseField>

### Measurements

#### Meter Readings

<ResponseField name="Meter" required>
  Meter ID used (references `id` in Meter model)
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Start Reading" required>
  Initial meter reading
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="End Reading" required>
  Final meter reading
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Measurement Unit" required>
  Unit for meter readings (references `id` in MeasurementUnit model) Example
  units: 'Cubic Meters' (m³), 'Barrels' (bbl), 'Gigajoules' (GJ)
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Factor" required>
  Correction factor applied to meter readings to account for meter calibration,
  temperature effects, pressure effects, product characteristics, etc.
</ResponseField>

#### Volume Measurements

All measurement units reference `id` in MeasurementUnit model

<ResponseField name="Volume" required>
  Total volume
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Net Volume" required>
  Volume of the product only (without water, etc)
</ResponseField>

Each with their own corresponding measurement unit fields. If a value is not
null, the measurement unit is required for the field.

### Quality Measurements

All measurement units reference `id` in MeasurementUnit model.

<ResponseField name="Density" required>
  Density of the fluid (e.g. kg/m³, lb/ft³)
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="BSW" required>
  Combined percentage of sediment and water content (e.g. %, ppm)
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Solids">
  Suspended solid particle content (e.g. %, ppm)
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Saltwater">
  Salt water content in the fluid (e.g. %, ppm)
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Sulfur">

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Vapor Pressure">
  Pressure exerted by fluid vapor (e.g. kPa, psi)
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Temperature">
  Temperature of the fluid (e.g. °C, °F)
</ResponseField>

Each with their own corresponding measurement unit fields. If a value is not
null, the measurement unit is required for the field.

### Transfer & Custody

<ResponseField name="Codes" required>
  The type of transfer or custody (e.g. REC, INV, DISP). Multiple codes may be
  specified (references `id` in Code model)
</ResponseField>
