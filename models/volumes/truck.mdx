## Overview

A truck ticket represents a product transfer between facilities via truck, including pickup and delivery details, measurements, and quality data.

## Attributes

### Identification

- **ID** (Required): The primary key idenitifier used inside the Flux system, unique across all organizations.

- **External ID** (Required): The internal idenitifier used inside the organization

- **Bill of Lading** (Required): BOL number

- **Rack Ticket**: Loading rack ticket number

- **Status** (Required): Status of the ticket in the Flux system

### Transportation

- **Carrier** (Required): Carrier that is transporting the product (references `id` in Carrier model)

- **Driver**: Driver of the carrier transporting the product (references `id` in User model)

### Locations & Entities

#### Pickup Location

- **Commercial Facility** (Required): Commercial facility where product is picked up (references `id` in CommercialFacility model)

<Info>
  Commercial facilities provide a way for organizations to group and track
  multiple physical facilities under a single logical entity. While regulatory
  facilities (batteries, terminals, etc.) each have unique IDs and locations,
  commercial facilities allow organizations to combine these into meaningful
  business units for marketing, stakeholder reporting, and internal tracking
  purposes. For example, multiple batteries with different regulator IDs might
  be grouped into one commercial facility that represents how the organization
  refers to that location internally.
</Info>

- **Commercial Entity** (Required): Entity that is transferring custody of the product (references `id` in Entity model)

- **Facility Operator** (Required): Entity that operates the pickup facility (references `id` in Entity model)

- **Well** (Required): Well ID where product originates (references `id` in Well model)

- **Pickup Facility** (Required): Each ID references the `id` field in their respective models and only one should be specified:

  - Battery

  - Terminal

  - Plant

  - Station

  - System

  - Pipeline

  - Resource

<Info>
  Each facility is unique by their `regulator_id` (e.g. ABBT0030001),
  `jurisdiction` (e.g. Alberta), and `regulator_system` (e.g. Petrinex) and is
  primarily used for production accounting purposes.
</Info>

#### Delivery Location

- **Commercial Facility** (Required): Facility where product is delivered to (references `id` in CommercialFacility model)

<Info>
  Commercial facilities provide a way for organizations to group and track
  multiple physical facilities under a single logical entity. While regulatory
  facilities (batteries, terminals, etc.) each have unique IDs and locations,
  commercial facilities allow organizations to combine these into meaningful
  business units for marketing, stakeholder reporting, and internal tracking
  purposes. For example, multiple batteries with different regulator IDs might
  be grouped into one commercial facility that represents how the organization
  refers to that location internally.
</Info>

- **Commercial Entity** (Required): Entity that is taking custody of the product (references `id` in Entity model)

- **Facility Operator** (Required): Entity that operates the delivery facility (references `id` in Entity model)

- **Delivery Facility** (Required): Each ID references the `id` field in their respective models and only one should be specified:

  - Battery

  - Terminal

  - Plant

  - Station

  - System

  - Pipeline

  - Resource

<Info>
  Each facility is unique by their `regulator_id` (e.g. ABBT0030001),
  `jurisdiction` (e.g. Alberta), and `regulator_system` (e.g. Petrinex) and is
  primarily used for production accounting purposes.
</Info>

### Timing

- **Production Date** (Required): Calendar day of the reported volume

- **Start** (Required): Start time of ticket

- **End** (Required): End time of ticket

- **Created At**: Timestamp of when the ticket was created in Flux

- **Updated At**: Timestamp of when the ticket was last updated in Flux

### Measurements

#### Meter Readings

- **Meter** (Required): Meter ID used (references `id` in Meter model)

- **Start Reading** (Required): Initial meter reading

- **End Reading** (Required): Final meter reading

- **Measurement Unit** (Required): Unit for meter readings (references `id` in MeasurementUnit model)

  - Example units: 'Cubic Meters' (m³), 'Barrels' (bbl), 'Gigajoules' (GJ)

- **Meter Factor** (Required): Correction factor applied to meter readings to account for meter calibration, temperature effects, pressure effects, product characteristics, etc.

#### Tank Readings

- **Opening Oil**: Initial oil level in the truck

- **Opening Water**: Initial water level in the truck

- **Ending Oil**: Final oil level in the truck

- **Ending Water**: Final water level in the truck

- **Measurement Unit**: Unit for tank readings (references `id` in MeasurementUnit model)

  - Example units: 'Cubic Meters' (m³), 'Barrels' (bbl), 'Gigajoules' (GJ)

#### Volume Measurements

All measurement units reference `id` in MeasurementUnit model

- **Volume** (Required): Total volume

- **Load Volume**: Loaded volume

- **Product Volume**: Volume of the product only (without water, etc)

Each with corresponding measurement units (e.g., m³, bbl, GJ)

### Quality Measurements

All measurement units reference `id` in MeasurementUnit model.

- **Density** (Required): Density of the fluid (e.g. kg/m³, lb/ft³)

- **BSW** (Required) (Basic Sediment and Water): Combined percentage of sediment and water content (e.g. %, ppm)

- **Solids**: Suspended solid particle content (e.g. %, ppm)

- **Saltwater**: Salt water content in the fluid (e.g. %, ppm)

- **Sulfur**: Sulfur content in the fluid (e.g. %, ppm)

- **Vapor Pressure**: Pressure exerted by fluid vapor (e.g. kPa, psi)

- **Temperature**: Temperature of the fluid (e.g. °C, °F)

### Transfer & Custody

- **Codes** (Required): The type of transfer (e.g. REC, INV, DISP)
