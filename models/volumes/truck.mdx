## Overview

A truck ticket represents a product transfer between facilities via truck, including pickup and delivery details, measurements, and quality data.

## Attributes

### Identification

<ResponseField name="ID" required>
  The primary key idenitifier used inside the Flux system, unique across all
  organizations.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="External ID" required>
  The internal idenitifier used inside the organization
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Bill of Lading" required>
  BOL number
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Rack Ticket">Loading rack ticket number</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Status" required>
  Status of the ticket in the Flux system
</ResponseField>

### Transportation

<ResponseField name="Carrier" required>
  Carrier that is transporting the product (references `id` in Carrier model)
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Driver">
  Driver of the carrier transporting the product (references `id` in User model)
</ResponseField>

### Locations & Entities

#### Pickup Location

<ResponseField name="Commercial Facility" required>
  Commercial facility where product is picked up (references `id` in
  CommercialFacility model)
</ResponseField>

<Info>
  Commercial facilities provide a way for organizations to group and track
  multiple physical facilities under a single logical entity. While regulatory
  facilities (batteries, terminals, etc.) each have unique IDs and locations,
  commercial facilities allow organizations to combine these into meaningful
  business units for marketing, stakeholder reporting, and internal tracking
  purposes. For example, multiple batteries with different regulator IDs might
  be grouped into one commercial facility that represents how the organization
  refers to that location internally.
</Info>

<ResponseField name="Commercial Entity" required>
  Entity that is transferring custody of the product (references `id` in Entity
  model)
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Facility Operator" required>
  Entity that operates the pickup facility (references `id` in Entity model)
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Well" required>
  Well ID where product originates (references `id` in Well model)
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Pickup Facility" required>
  Each ID references the `id` field in their respective models and only one
  should be specified: Battery, Terminal, Plant, Station, System, Pipeline, and
  Resource
</ResponseField>

<Info>
  Each facility is unique by their `regulator_id` (e.g. ABBT0030001),
  `jurisdiction` (e.g. Alberta), and `regulator_system` (e.g. Petrinex) and is
  primarily used for production accounting purposes.
</Info>

#### Delivery Location

<ResponseField name="Commercial Facility" required>
  Facility where product is delivered to (references `id` in CommercialFacility
  model)
</ResponseField>

<Info>
  Commercial facilities provide a way for organizations to group and track
  multiple physical facilities under a single logical entity. While regulatory
  facilities (batteries, terminals, etc.) each have unique IDs and locations,
  commercial facilities allow organizations to combine these into meaningful
  business units for marketing, stakeholder reporting, and internal tracking
  purposes. For example, multiple batteries with different regulator IDs might
  be grouped into one commercial facility that represents how the organization
  refers to that location internally.
</Info>

<ResponseField name="Commercial Entity" required>
  Entity that is taking custody of the product (references `id` in Entity model)
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Facility Operator" required>
  Entity that operates the delivery facility (references `id` in Entity model)
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Delivery Facility" required>
  Each ID references the `id` field in their respective models and only one
  should be specified: - Battery - Terminal - Plant - Station - System -
  Pipeline - Resource
</ResponseField>

<Info>
  Each facility is unique by their `regulator_id` (e.g. ABBT0030001),
  `jurisdiction` (e.g. Alberta), and `regulator_system` (e.g. Petrinex) and is
  primarily used for production accounting purposes.
</Info>
