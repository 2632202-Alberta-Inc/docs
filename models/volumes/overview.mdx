Flux uses tickets system to track and measure volumes of oil, gas, and other products across production facilities. Each ticket provides a snapshot of volume and product characteristics at specific points in time.

## Truck Ticket

Truck tickets are essential for tracking the movement of products via tanker trucks between facilities. These tickets are vital for ensuring accurate custody transfer of products like crude oil, condensate, and produced water transported by road. [Learn more about truck tickets](/models/volumes/truck)

## Tank Ticket
