title: "Overview"
description: "Flux uses a ticketing system to track and measure volumes of oil, gas, and other products across production facilities. Each ticket provides a snapshot of volume and product characteristics at specific points in time, facilitating accurate tracking of product ownership and transfer status."

## Truck Ticket

Truck tickets are essential for tracking the movement of products via tanker trucks between facilities. These tickets are vital for ensuring accurate custody transfer of products like crude oil, condensate, and produced water transported by road. [Learn more about truck tickets](/models/volumes/truck)

## Tank Ticket

Tank tickets document point in time measurements of product in storage tanks at facilities. These tickets are critical for inventory management and reconciliation at batteries, terminals, and other storage facilities. [Learn more about tank tickets](/models/volumes/tank)

## Meter Ticket

Meter tickets capture continuous flow measurement data from meters installed on pipelines and facility equipment. These tickets provide accurate measurement for pipeline transfers, facility throughput, and regulatory reporting requirements. [Learn more about meter tickets](/models/volumes/meter)

## Ticket Status

Tickets follow a dynamic status workflow that helps ensure accurate data quality and timely completeness:

1. **`INCOMPLETE`**

   - Initial status when ticket is missing required data

   - System automatically identifies missing or invalid fields

   - Ticket can be updated via API to provide missing information

2. **`PENDING_REVIEW`**

   - All required fields are present

   - Assigned automatically by the system when data completeness checks pass

3. **`DISPUTED`**

   - Issues identified during data analyst review (e.g. anomolous volumes)

   - May indicate measurement discrepancies or data inconsistencies

   - Requires investigation and manual correction

4. **`APPROVED`**

   - Data verified by authorized data personnel

   - Ready for production accounting verification

5. **`CLOSED`**

   - Ticket has been verified by production accounting

   - Data ready for use in downstream systems

   - Ticket is immutable, no further modifications are allowed

6. **`CANCELED`**

   - Ticket has been voided

   - Will not be used for reporting or in downstream systems

   - Remains for auditing purposes

## Workflow

1. **Creation**

   - Ticket created via API

   - System automatically assigns initial `PENDING` status

   - Validation errors logged if present

2. **Validation**

   - System checks for:

     - Existence checks for all referenced entities (facilities, wells, meters, etc.)

     - Required field validation

     - Facility type validation (only one pickup/delivery facility type allowed)

     - Measurement unit validation

     - Timestamp validation

     - Volume and reading validations

     - Status updated based on validation results

3. **Review**

   - Production accounting teams and data analysts can review tickets

   - UI interface available for manual corrections and review

4. **Resolution**

   - Tickets can be updated via API

   - Each update triggers revalidation

- Each field can have multiple validation errors

- Errors must be resolved before status can advance

- Error history maintained for audit purposes

## Audit Trail `Coming Soon`

- All status changes are timestamped

- Previous values are preserved

- User/system making changes is recorded

- Complete history available for compliance
