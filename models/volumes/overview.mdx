## Types

In the Flux system, tickets play a crucial role in tracking and measuring the volumes of oil, gas, and other products across facilities and transportation. Each ticket serves as a record that captures essential data at specific points in time, ensuring accurate inventory management, custody transfer, and regulatory compliance.

### Truck Ticket

Truck tickets are essential for tracking the movement of products via tanker trucks between facilities. These tickets are vital for ensuring accurate custody transfer of products like crude oil, condensate, and produced water transported by road. [Learn more about truck tickets](/models/volumes/truck)

### Tank Ticket

Tank tickets document point in time measurements of product in storage tanks at facilities. These tickets are critical for inventory management and reconciliation at batteries, terminals, and other storage facilities. [Learn more about tank tickets](/models/volumes/tank)

### Meter Ticket

Meter tickets capture continuous flow measurement data from meters installed on pipelines and facility equipment. These tickets provide accurate measurement for pipeline transfers, facility throughput, and regulatory reporting requirements. [Learn more about meter tickets](/models/volumes/meter)

## Ticket Status

Ticket status tracks the state of a ticket through its lifecycle, from creation to final verification, ensuring proper data quality and workflow management:

- **`INCOMPLETE`**: Default initial status when ticket is created. Indicates required data is missing. _(Automatically triggered)_
- **`PENDING_REVIEW`**: All required fields are present and validated; system automatically transitions ticket to this status. _(Automatically triggered)_
- **`DISPUTED`**: Can only be set after `PENDING_REVIEW`. Indicates issues were found during review that require investigation. _(Human-triggered)_
- **`APPROVED`**: Can only be set after `PENDING_REVIEW`. Indicates data has been verified by authorized personnel for completeness and is ready for production accounting verification. _(Human-triggered)_
- **`CLOSED`**: Can only be set after `PENDING_REVIEW`. Indicates final verification by production accounting is complete. Ticket becomes immutable. _(Human-triggered)_
- **`CANCELED`**: Ticket has been voided but retained for audit purposes. Can be triggered at any point in the workflow. _(Human-triggered)_

## Transfer and Custody Codes

- **INV**: Inventory

- **BLEND**: Product blend

- **INJ**: Injected product

- **DISP**: Disposition

- **LOCAL**: Local transfer between facilities within same organization

- **REC**: Received product

- **SHIP**: Shipped product

- **SHIP_INV**: Shipped inventory

- **SALE**: Sold inventory

- **PRE_INV**: Measurement before inventory point

- **POST_INV**: Measurement after inventory point

- **IN_OUT**: General inbound/outbound movement between facilities
