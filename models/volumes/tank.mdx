## Overview

A tank ticket represents a point in time measurements of product in storage tanks at facilities. It captures tank measurements, quality data, and facility details to track product volumes and characteristics at a specific point in time.

## Attributes

### Identification

<ResponseField name="ID" required>
  The primary key idenitifier used inside the Flux system, unique across all
  organizations.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="External ID" required>
  The internal idenitifier used inside the organization
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Status" required>
  Status of the ticket in the Flux system
</ResponseField>

### Locations & Entities

<ResponseField name="Commercial Facility" required>
  Commercial facility where product is measured at (references `id` in
  CommercialFacility model)
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Commercial Entity" required>
  Entity that has custody of the product (references `id` in Entity model)
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Facility Operator" required>
  Entity that operates the facility (references `id` in Entity model)
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Facility" required>
  Each ID references the `id` field in their respective models and only one
  should be specified: Battery, Terminal, Plant, Station, System, and Resource
</ResponseField>

<Info>
  Commercial facilities allow organizations to combine multiple facilities into
  meaningful business units for marketing, stakeholder reporting, internal
  tracking purposes, etc.
</Info>

<Info>
  Each facility is unique by their `regulator_id` (e.g. ABBT0030001),
  `jurisdiction` (e.g. Alberta), and `regulator_system` (e.g. Petrinex) and is
  customarily used for production accounting purposes.
</Info>

### Timing

  Calendar day of the reported volume
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Start" required>
  Start time of ticket
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="End" required>
  End time of ticket
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Created At">
  Timestamp of when the ticket was created in Flux
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Updated At">
  Timestamp of when the ticket was last updated in Flux
</ResponseField>

### Measurements

  units: 'Cubic Meters' (m³), 'Barrels' (bbl), 'Gigajoules' (GJ)
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Factor" required>
