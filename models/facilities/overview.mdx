Flux utilizes a comprehensive model to represent various types of facilities. Each facility type is defined with specific attributes and relationships.

### Facilities

A facility is a representation of a physical location that is unique by their `regulator_id` (e.g. ABBT0030001), `jurisdiction` (e.g. Alberta), and `regulator_system` (e.g. Petrinex). [Learn more about facilities](/models/facilities/facility)

### Commercial Facilities

Commercial facilities allow organizations to combine multiple facilities into
meaningful business units for marketing, stakeholder reporting, internal
tracking purposes, etc.[Learn more about commercial facilities](/models/facilities/commercial_facilities)

### Facility Status

Facilities are subject to various licensing and operational statuses as reported by regulatory systems. [Learn more about facility statuses](/models/facilities/status)
