Flux utilizes a comprehensive model to represent various types of facilities. Each facility type is defined with specific attributes and relationships.

### Commercial Facilities

Commercial facilities allow organizations to combine multiple facilities into
meaningful business units for marketing, stakeholder reporting, internal
tracking purposes, etc. [Learn more about commercial facilities](/models/facilities/commercial_facilities)

### Facilities

A facility is a representation of a physical location that is unique by their `regulator_id` (e.g. ABBT0030001), `jurisdiction` (e.g. Alberta), and `regulator_system` (e.g. Petrinex). [Learn more about facilities](/models/facilities/facility)

### Facility Types

Facility types are regulatory categories (e.g. "BT" for Battery in Petrinex) that map to Flux facility models like Battery, Terminal, and Plant. These mappings allow consistent classification across different regulatory systems. [Learn more about facility types](/models/facilities/facility#types)

### Facility Sub Types

Facility sub types link regulatory sub-categories to their parent regulatory types (e.g. "902" Custom Treating Battery links to "BT" Battery type in Petrinex). These sub type mappings ensure accurate representation and hierarchical classification of regulatory facilities in Flux models.
