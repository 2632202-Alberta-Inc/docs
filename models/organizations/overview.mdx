Flux utilizes a comprehensive model to represent organizations, their legal entities, and users. This hierarchical structure allows for proper management of complex business relationships.

### Organizations

Organizations are the top-level grouping in Flux, representing a business as a whole (e.g. "Flux"). Organizations can contain multiple legal entities across different jurisdictions and manage users centrally. [Learn more about organizations](/models/organizations/organization)

### Entities

Entities represent the legal entities of an organization within specific jurisdictions. For example, while "Flux" is the organization, "Flux Operating Systems Ltd." would be an entity in a particular jurisdiction. Each entity has attributes like legal name, jurisdiction, and regulatory identifiers. [Learn more about entities](/models/organizations/entity)

### Users

Users are individuals who access and interact with the Flux platform. Users are associated with organizations rather than specific entities, allowing them to work across all entities within their organization based on their roles and permissions.
