Flux uses government regulatory data as its foundational source of truth. By ingesting and standardizing data from various government agencies and jurisdictions, we create a single source of truth that all commercial relationships, transactions and reporting are built upon. This ensures compliance and data consistency across the platform.

### Regulatory Systems

A system refers to the reporting platform or framework used for regulatory compliance within a jurisdiction. For example, Petrinex is the system used in Western Canada for oil and gas production reporting, while other regions may use different systems to facilitate similar reporting requirements.

### Regulatory and Legal Jurisdictions

A jurisdiction represents the geographic region or territory that defines where an entity operates and is registered. Jurisdictions are crucial for distinguishing between entities, as organizations may have multiple entities with similar or identical names registered in different regions.
