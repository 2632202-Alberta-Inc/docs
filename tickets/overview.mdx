## Ticket Statuses

Tickets follow a dynamic status workflow that helps ensure accurate data quality and timely completeness:

### Status Types

1. **`INCOMPLETE`**

   * Initial status when ticket is missing required data

   * System automatically identifies missing or invalid fields

   * Ticket can be updated via API to provide missing information

2. **PENDING_REVIEW**

   * All required fields are present

   * Assigned automatically by the system when data completeness checks pass

3. **DISPUTED**

   * Issues identified during data analyst review (e.g. anomolous volumes)

   * May indicate measurement discrepancies or data inconsistencies

   * Requires investigation and manual correction

4. **APPROVED**

   * Data verified by authorized data personnel

   * Ready for production accounting verification

5. **CLOSED**

   * Ticket has been verified by production accounting

   * Data ready for use in downstream systems

   * Ticket is immutable, no further modifications are allowed

6. **CANCELED**

   * Ticket has been voided

   * Will not be used for reporting or in downstream systems

   * Remains for auditing purposes

### Workflow Process

1. **Creation**

   * Ticket created via API

   * System automatically assigns initial `PENDING` status

   * Validation errors logged if present

2. **Validation**

   * System checks for:

     * Required fields

     * Data consistency

     * Reference validity

     * Measurement anomalies

   * Status updated based on validation results

3. **Review**

   * Production accounting teams and data analysts can review tickets

   * UI interface available for manual corrections and updates

4. **Resolution**

   * Tickets can be updated via API

   * Each update triggers revalidation

   * Status changes tracked for audit purposes

### Error Handling

* Each field can have multiple validation errors

* Errors must be resolved before status can advance

* Error history maintained for audit purposes

* Updates via API trigger error rechecks

### Audit Trail

* All status changes are timestamped

* Previous values are preserved

* User/system making changes is recorded

* Complete history available for compliance
