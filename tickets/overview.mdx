Flux supports three main types of tickets:

### Truck Tickets

Truck tickets record the movement of products via tanker trucks between facilities. These capture:

- Pickup and delivery locations/facilities
- Carrier and driver information
- Bill of lading and rack ticket numbers
- Production date and timestamps
- Load volumes and measurements
- Product quality specifications:
  - Density
  - Basic sediment and water (BSW)
  - Temperature
  - Vapor pressure
  - Sulfur content
- Tank gauging data (opening/closing levels)
- Meter readings and factors

Truck tickets are essential for tracking custody transfer of products like crude oil, condensate, and produced water being transported by road.

### Tank Tickets

Tank tickets document product measurements and transfers involving storage tanks at facilities. They record:

- Location and facility information
- Production date and timestamps
- Meter readings and factors
- Volume measurements
- Product quality specifications:
  - Density
  - Basic sediment and water (BSW)
  - Solids content
  - Saltwater content
  - Sulfur content
  - Vapor pressure
  - Temperature

These tickets are critical for inventory management and reconciliation at batteries, terminals and other storage facilities.

### Meter Tickets

Meter tickets capture continuous flow measurement data from meters installed on pipelines and facility equipment. They include:

- Location and facility information
- Production date and timestamps
- Meter readings and factors
- Volume measurements
- Product quality specifications:
  - Density
  - Basic sediment and water (BSW)
  - Solids content
  - Saltwater content
  - Sulfur content
  - Vapor pressure
  - Temperature

Meter tickets provide accurate measurement for pipeline transfers, facility throughput, and regulatory reporting requirements.

## Ticket Statuses

Tickets follow a dynamic status workflow that helps ensure accurate data quality and timely completeness:

1. **`INCOMPLETE`**

   - Initial status when ticket is missing required data

   - System automatically identifies missing or invalid fields

   - Ticket can be updated via API to provide missing information

2. **`PENDING_REVIEW`**

   - All required fields are present

   - Assigned automatically by the system when data completeness checks pass

3. **`DISPUTED`**

   - Issues identified during data analyst review (e.g. anomolous volumes)

   - May indicate measurement discrepancies or data inconsistencies

   - Requires investigation and manual correction

4. **`APPROVED`**

   - Data verified by authorized data personnel

   - Ready for production accounting verification

5. **`CLOSED`**

   - Ticket has been verified by production accounting

   - Data ready for use in downstream systems

   - Ticket is immutable, no further modifications are allowed

6. **`CANCELED`**

   - Ticket has been voided

   - Will not be used for reporting or in downstream systems

   - Remains for auditing purposes

### Workflow Process

1. **Creation**

   - Ticket created via API

   - System automatically assigns initial `PENDING` status

   - Validation errors logged if present

2. **Validation**

   - System checks for:

     - Required fields

     - Data consistency

     - Reference validity

     - Measurement anomalies

   - Status updated based on validation results

3. **Review**

   - Production accounting teams and data analysts can review tickets

   - UI interface available for manual corrections and updates

4. **Resolution**

   - Tickets can be updated via API

   - Each update triggers revalidation

   - Status changes tracked for audit purposes

- Each field can have multiple validation errors

- Errors must be resolved before status can advance

- Error history maintained for audit purposes

- Updates via API trigger error rechecks

### Audit Trail `Coming Soon`

- All status changes are timestamped

- Previous values are preserved

- User/system making changes is recorded

- Complete history available for compliance
