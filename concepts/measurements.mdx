### Overview

Every recorded value in Flux has an associated measurement unit to ensure accurate tracking and conversion of quantities. The system supports automatic unit conversions between compatible measurement categories (e.g. volume, temperature, density, etc.), allowing seamless integration of data recorded in different unit systems while maintaining accuracy and consistency.

### Measurement Categories

Measurement categories are used to group related measurement units. For example, "Volume" includes units like "Barrel", "Cubic Meter", and "Gallon". You may not convert between measurement units in different categories (e.g. you cannot convert between volume and temperature).

### Measurement Units

Measurement units are defined with:

- Name (e.g., "Barrel")
- Symbol (e.g., "BBL")
- Measurement Category (e.g., "Volume")

This allows for accurate unit conversions while maintaining an audit trail of historical unit definitions. The system can automatically convert amounts between any supported units using the latest available unit definitions.

### Conversion Factors

Conversion factors define how to convert between measurement units for specific product categories. Each conversion factor contains:

- Product Category (e.g., "Crude Oil", "Natural Gas")
- From Measurement Unit (e.g., "Cubic Meter")
- To Measurement Unit (e.g., "Barrel")
- Formula (e.g., "M3 \* 6.29287")
