### Overview

Flux OS uses pricing models like Equalizations and WADFs to ensure accurate financial calculations in contracts. These models help standardize pricing based on key variables such as product quality, location, or contract terms.

### Equalizations

Equalizations adjust pricing to balance differences in factors like quality, ensuring fair transactions. They are applied within contracts to align pricing with agreed-upon terms.

### Weighted Average Differential Factors (WADFs)

Weighted Average Differential Factors (WADFs) adjust pricing based on weighted variables such as stream quality. WADFs ensure consistency and accuracy in contract pricing calculations.
