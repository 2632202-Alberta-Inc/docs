### Overview

The Flux OS service provides service endpoints that enable developers to build applications easier and integrate more reliably with the platform.

### Ping Endpoint

Flux provides a simple ping endpoint that allows external systems to verify the API service is up and running. This endpoint can be used for:

- Health checks from monitoring systems
- Validating connectivity before starting data transfers
- Confirming API availability during system integration
- Basic service status monitoring

The ping endpoint returns a simple response indicating the service is operational, making it ideal for automated monitoring and alerting systems.
