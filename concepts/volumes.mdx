### Overview

Flux uses tickets system to track and measure volumes of oil, gas, and other products across production facilities. Each ticket provides a snapshot of volume and product characteristics at specific points in time.

### Meters

Meters are the physical devices that measure volumes of products. In Flux, each ticket is associated with a meter and captures point in time or flow measurment data.

### Truck Tickets

Truck tickets are essential for tracking the movement of products via tanker trucks between facilities. These tickets are vital for ensuring accurate custody transfer of products like crude oil, condensate, and produced water transported by road.

### Tank Tickets

Tank tickets document point in time measurements of product in storage tanks at facilities. These tickets are critical for inventory management and reconciliation at batteries, terminals, and other storage facilities.

### Meter Tickets

Meter tickets capture continuous flow measurement data from meters installed on pipelines and facility equipment. These tickets provide accurate measurement for pipeline transfers, facility throughput, and regulatory reporting requirements.

### Ticket Statuses

Ticket status tracks the state of a ticket through its lifecycle, from creation to final verification, ensuring proper data quality and workflow management.

### Ticket Codes

Ticket codes identify the type of custody transfer or inventory movement represented by a ticket. These standardized codes help categorize and track different kinds of volume measurements and transfers throughout the production and transportation process, enabling accurate accounting, reconciliation, and reporting.
