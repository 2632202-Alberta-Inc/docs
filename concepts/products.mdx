### Overview

Flux OS manages products through two distinct "swim lanes":

1. **Physical**

   - Represents actual, measurable characteristics of products
   - Represented by **Product Categories** that classify incoming products
   - Controlled by **Mechanical Bands** that define facility-level mechanical limits

2. **Commercial**
   - Defines how products are classified and traded in the market
   - Organized into **Streams** that represent standardized market classifications
   - Governed by **Commercial Bands** that specify quality requirements for trading

### Product Categories (Physical Characteristics)

Product categories are classifications of actual measurable characteristics of products.

### Streams (Commercial Representations)

Streams represent standardized market classifications with strict quality requirements that must be met for sale and delivery. For example:

- Mixed Sweet Blend (MSW)
- Premium Condensate
- Light Sour Blend

### Commercial Bands

Commercial bands are defined at the commercial facility level, setting property ranges that classify products from a commercial perspective for both inbound and outbound purposes. These include:

- Density (kg/m³)
- H2S
- BSW

For example, products with 780 kg/m³ density, 0.02 wt% Sulphur, and 0.6% BSW may be classified as "Crudensate Emulsion" based on the measurement of the physical properties of the product and the range of properties defined in the commercial band at that commercial facility.

### Mechanical Bands

Mechanical bands are set at the facility level, representing actual mechanical limitations of the equipment. This is crucial for optimization and blending purposes to avoid being shut in or encountering safety issues due to mechanical limitations.
