### Overview

This guide explains how Flux OS models the complex relationships and data structures found in the oil and gas industry. Understanding these core concepts will help you effectively use the API and integrate with the platform.

Our data models are designed to accurately represent:

- Physical assets (e.g. wells, facilities, meters, tanks)
- Commercial arrangements (e.g. deals, contracts, premiums, profit shares) and business relationships
- Legal entities and organizational structures
- Regulatory compliance and reporting requirements
- Volume measurement and custody transfer
- Financial transactions and currency conversions
- Measurement unit conversions and standardization across different systems (e.g. metric to imperial)
- Product streams, physical classifications, and facility lebel based classifications (e.g. mechanical bands, commercial bands)
- Measurement unit conversions between different unit types (e.g. volume to energy)
- Pricing (e.g. WADF, equalization) and fees (e.g. volume based fees, percentage based fees, flat fees)
- Threads, messages, and their associations (e.g. organizations, deals, contracts, schedules, line items, users, entities)

The models are built to be flexible enough to handle different jurisdictions and regulatory systems while maintaining data integrity and traceability.
