### Overview

In Flux OS, messages are organized into threads, allowing for different types of conversations such as direct messages or channels. These threads facilitate communication both internally and externally, providing options for private or public interactions. Threads can also be related to various concepts within Flux, such as participants, organizations, deals, contracts, and schedules, offering easier access and context.

### Thread

Threads serve as the backbone for conversations, categorizing them into types like direct messages or channels. This categorization helps in identifying the nature of the conversation, whether it's a private discussion or a public channel, and ensures that communication is organized and efficient.

### Message

Messages are the individual units of communication within a thread. They capture the sender's information, the content of the message, and any replies to previous messages. This structure ensures that conversations are coherent and that the flow of communication is maintained over time.

### Relationships

- **Organizations**: Threads can be associated with organizations, allowing easy access to view all related threads and messages.
- **Deals**: Threads can be linked to deals, providing a centralized view of all deal-related discussions.
- **Contracts**: Threads can be associated with contracts, enabling users to access all threads and messages related to a contract.
- **Schedules**: Threads can be connected to schedules, offering a straightforward way to view all related communication.
- **Line Items**: Threads can relate to schedule line items, allowing users to see all detailed discussions and messages.
- **Users**: Threads can be associated with individual users, facilitating the tracking and viewing of all conversations involving a specific user.
- **Entities**: Threads can link to various entities, providing a comprehensive view of all relevant threads and messages.

These relationships ensure that communication is not only organized but also contextually relevant, enhancing the overall efficiency and effectiveness of interactions within Flux OS.
