### Overview

Wells are distinct from facilities - they represent the physical points where products are extracted from the ground. Each well is uniquely identified within a jurisdiction through its regulator ID and legal land description components.

### Well Licensing

Wells are licensed to specific entities and have associated licensing statuses (e.g., Issued, Suspended, Abandoned) and types that are tracked for regulatory compliance. License details include the license number and issue date.

### Well Location

Beyond the legal land description, wells may have specific geographic coordinates (latitude/longitude) and location exceptions that provide precise positioning information.

### Well Identification

Wells are assigned unique identifiers like the UWI (Unique Well Identifier) in Western Canada, which encode information about the well's location and purpose. They also maintain regulator-specific IDs within each jurisdiction's regulatory system.

### Well-Entity Relationships

Wells are licensed to specific legal entities who are responsible for their operation and regulatory compliance. These relationships are tracked along with the current licensing status and any changes in ownership or operational responsibility.
