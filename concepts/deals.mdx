### Overview

Deals are a top-level representation of a commercial strategy in Flux OS. They allow traders to group multiple contracts together to manage their strategies more effectively.

For example, if a trader is buying 1,000 cubes of heavy oil, they may enter into 10 separate contracts to purchase the oil while simultaneously entering into another contract to sell 1,000 cubes of light oil. These contracts can be grouped together into a deal.

By organizing contracts into deals, organizations can track key metrics such as profitability, volume, and exposure at various levels: per trader, per deal, per contract, etc.
