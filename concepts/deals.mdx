### Overview

Deals are a top level representation of a commercail strategy in Flux OS. They are used to represent a traders strategy by allowing multiple contracts to be grouped together. For example, if a trader is buying 1000 cubes of heavy oil, they may enter into 10 separate contracts to purchase the oil, and simultaneously enter into a separate contract to sell 1000 cubes of light oil. These contracts can be grouped together by creating a deal. This allows metrics to be calculated per strategy, by trader, etc.
