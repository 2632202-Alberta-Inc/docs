### Overview

This guide shows you how to make your first API request to Flux OS.

## Prerequisites

You'll need:

1. A Flux OS account for your organization
2. API credentials (API key and user ID)

Don't have an account? Contact [sales@flux-os.com](mailto:sales@flux-os.com) to get started.

## Making Requests

To start working with the API, youâ€™ll first need to know the base server endpoint that all requests should be directed to:

```
https://v1.api.flux-os.com
```

All API requests require two authentication headers: `x-api-key` and `x-user-id`. Contact [support@flux-os.com](mailto:support@flux-os.com) for API credentials.

Here is a sample Python request using the `requests` library:

```python
import requests

base_url = "https://v1.api.flux-os.com"
path = "/ping"

headers = {
    "x-api-key": "YOUR_API_KEY",
    "x-user-id": "YOUR_USER_ID"
}

response = requests.get(base_url + path, headers=headers)

print(response.status_code)
print(response.json())
```

To see all available API endpoints, refer to our comprehensive [documentation and API playground](/api-reference/service/ping-server).
