title: "Volumes"
---

Flux provides a robust system for tracking volumes through tickets that capture measurements and transfers across facilities. This guide will help you understand how to add tickets to track your volumes effectively.

## Types of Tickets

There are three main types of tickets you can create:

- **Truck Tickets**: Track product movements via tanker trucks between facilities
- **Tank Tickets**: Record point-in-time measurements of product in storage tanks
- **Meter Tickets**: Capture continuous flow measurement data from meters

Each ticket type has specific required fields and validation rules. See the [Models documentation](/models/volumes/overview) for detailed specifications.

## Adding Tickets

To add a new ticket:

1. Determine the appropriate ticket type based on your measurement scenario.
2. Gather required data like facility IDs, timestamps, volumes, and product characteristics.
3. Submit the ticket via API with all required fields:
4. Check the response for any validation errors.
5. Correct any issues and resubmit if needed using the same appropriate endpoint.

## Workflow

1. **Creation**

   - Ticket created via API using the appropriate endpoint.

     - For **Truck Tickets**: [`POST /tickets/truck`](/api-reference/volumes/create-truck-ticket) - Create Truck Ticket
     - For **Tank Tickets**: [`POST /tickets/tank`](/api-reference/volumes/create-tank-ticket) - Create Tank Ticket
     - For **Meter Tickets**: [`POST /tickets/meter`](/api-reference/volumes/create-meter-ticket) - Create Meter Ticket

   - System assigns initial `PENDING` status.
   - Validation errors logged if present.

2. **Validation**

   Automatically triggered on every `POST` and `PATCH` request.

   - Existence checks for all referenced entities (facilities, wells, meters, etc.)
   - Required field validation.
   - Facility type validation (only one pickup/delivery facility type allowed).
   - Measurement unit validation.
   - Timestamp validation.
   - Volume and reading validations.
   - Status updated based on validation results.
   - Anomoly detection and validation. `Coming Soon`

3. **Review**

   - Search tickets by status to find tickets with errors

     - [`GET  /tickets/truck`](/api-reference/volumes/list-truck-tickets) - List Truck Tickets
     - [`GET  /tickets/tank`](/api-reference/volumes/list-tank-tickets) - List Tank Tickets
     - [`GET  /tickets/meter`](/api-reference/volumes/list-meter-tickets) - List Meter Tickets

   - Get ticket details to review and fix errors

     - [`GET  /tickets/truck/{id}`](/api-reference/volumes/get-truck-ticket) - Get Truck Ticket
     - [`GET  /tickets/tank/{id}`](/api-reference/volumes/get-tank-ticket) - Get Tank Ticket
     - [`GET  /tickets/meter/{id}`](/api-reference/volumes/get-meter-ticket) - Get Meter Ticket

   - UI interface available for manual corrections and review. `Coming Soon`

4. **Resolution**

   - Tickets can be updated via API using the appropriate endpoint:

     - For **Truck Tickets**: [`PATCH /tickets/truck/{id}`](/api-reference/volumes/update-truck-ticket)
     - For **Tank Tickets**: [`PATCH /tickets/tank/{id}`](/api-reference/volumes/update-tank-ticket)
     - For **Meter Tickets**: [`PATCH /tickets/meter/{id}`](/api-reference/volumes/update-meter-ticket)

   - Each update triggers revalidation.
   - Each field can have multiple validation errors.
   - Errors must be resolved before status can advance.
   - Error history maintained for audit purposes.
