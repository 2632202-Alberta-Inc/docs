### Overview

Flux provides a robust system for tracking volumes through tickets that capture measurements in and transfers across facilities. This guide will help you understand how to add, update, and review tickets to track your volumes effectively.

### Types of Tickets

There are three main types of tickets you can create:

- **Truck Tickets**: Track product movements between facilities via trucks
- **Tank Tickets**: Record point-in-time measurements of product in storage tanks
- **Meter Tickets**: Capture continuous flow measurement data from meters

Each ticket type has specific required fields and validation rules. See the [volumes](/concepts/volumes) for detailed specifications.

### Adding Tickets

To add a new ticket:

1. Choose the ticket type.
2. Gather required data (Facility IDs, Entity IDs, timestamps, measurements, etc.).
3. Search for existing ticket by `external_id`.
4. Create the ticket via API.
5. Retrieve and check for any errors.
6. Update the ticket if needed.
7. If no errors, status automatically transitions to `PENDING_REVIEW`.

<Tip>
  Note: While Flux assigns a unique `id` to each ticket, you provide an
  `external_id` that must be unique within your organization. This prevents
  accidentally creating duplicate tickets.
</Tip>

### Workflow

1. **Creation**

   - Ticket created via API using the appropriate endpoint.

     - For **Truck Tickets**: [`POST /tickets/truck`](/api-reference/volumes/create-truck-ticket) - Create Truck Ticket
     - For **Tank Tickets**: [`POST /tickets/tank`](/api-reference/volumes/create-tank-ticket) - Create Tank Ticket
     - For **Meter Tickets**: [`POST /tickets/meter`](/api-reference/volumes/create-meter-ticket) - Create Meter Ticket

   - System assigns initial `PENDING` status.

2. **Validation**

   Automatically triggered on every `POST` and `PATCH` request.

   - Existence checks for all referenced entities (e.g. facilities, entities, meters, etc.)
   - Required field validation.
   - Facility type validation (e.g. only one pickup/delivery facility type allowed).
   - Measurement unit validation (e.g. temperature units must not be used for volume fields).
   - Timestamp validation.
   - Volume and reading validations.
   - Status updated based on validation results.
   - Ticket Code validation (e.g. `SALE` or `REC` codes require both destination and source fields on Meter Tickets).
   - Anomoly detection and validation. `Coming Soon`

<Tip>
  Note: Meter tickets require both destination and source fields only for `SALE`
  or `REC` codes. Otherwise, only destination fields are required.
</Tip>

3. **Review**

   - Search tickets by `PENDING` status to find tickets with errors

     - [`GET  /tickets/truck`](/api-reference/volumes/list-truck-tickets) - List Truck Tickets
     - [`GET  /tickets/tank`](/api-reference/volumes/list-tank-tickets) - List Tank Tickets
     - [`GET  /tickets/meter`](/api-reference/volumes/list-meter-tickets) - List Meter Tickets

   - Get ticket details to review and fix errors

     - [`GET  /tickets/truck/{id}`](/api-reference/volumes/get-truck-ticket) - Get Truck Ticket
     - [`GET  /tickets/tank/{id}`](/api-reference/volumes/get-tank-ticket) - Get Tank Ticket
     - [`GET  /tickets/meter/{id}`](/api-reference/volumes/get-meter-ticket) - Get Meter Ticket

   - UI interface available for manual corrections and review. `Coming Soon`

4. **Resolution**

   - Tickets can be updated via API using the appropriate endpoint:

     - For **Truck Tickets**: [`PATCH /tickets/truck/{id}`](/api-reference/volumes/update-truck-ticket)
     - For **Tank Tickets**: [`PATCH /tickets/tank/{id}`](/api-reference/volumes/update-tank-ticket)
     - For **Meter Tickets**: [`PATCH /tickets/meter/{id}`](/api-reference/volumes/update-meter-ticket)

   - Each update triggers revalidation.
   - Each field can have multiple validation errors.
   - Errors must be resolved before status can advance to `PENDING_REVIEW`.
   - Error history maintained for audit purposes.
