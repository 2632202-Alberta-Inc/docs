## Authentication

To authenticate your API requests, the Flux OS API requires two headers: `x-api-key` and `x-user-id`. You can generate your keys in the [app settings](https://www.flux-os.com/app/settings) view in your dashboard.

## Roles

Roles in Flux OS define a userâ€™s function within your organization in the public directory. A user can be assigned multiple roles to reflect their responsibilities. Below are some of the key roles available:

- **Trader**: Responsible for managing trading activities, such as buying and selling commodities.
- **Marketing**: Develops and executes marketing strategies for company products and services.
- **Finance**: Handles all financial aspects, including transactions, budgeting, and financial reporting.
- **Accounting**: Manages financial records, general ledger, and regulatory reporting for compliance.
- **Executive**: Oversees high-level strategic decisions, company operations, and corporate governance.
- **Operations**: Manages day-to-day operations, including production, maintenance, and logistics.
- **Engineering**: Responsible for designing, managing, and optimizing infrastructure and technical systems.
- **Logistics**: Oversees the movement and transportation of products, ensuring efficient supply chain management.
- **Legal**: Manages legal contracts, regulatory compliance, and any legal matters within the company.
- **Human Resources (HR)**: Handles employee relations, recruitment, training, and workforce management.
- **Health, Safety, and Environment (HSE)**: Ensures adherence to safety protocols and environmental regulations.
- **IT (Information Technology)**: Manages technological infrastructure, cybersecurity, and IT systems.
- **Project Management**: Oversees large projects, ensuring they are delivered on time, within scope, and on budget.
- **Supply Chain**: Manages procurement, vendor relations, and supply chain logistics for the company.
- **Compliance**: Ensures the company adheres to industry standards, regulations, and legal requirements.

A user can have more than one role, allowing for flexibility in permissions and access depending on their job function.

## Permissions

Permissions control what a user can do within Flux OS, regardless of their role. Currently, there are five permission levels:

- **Admin**: Grants full access to manage settings, data, and system configurations. Admins can also modify roles and permissions.
- **Front Office**: Grants ability to create and modify deals until execution, enter temporary pricing and rates, and access sandbox environments. Front Office users can initiate but not finalize transactions.
- **Mid Office**: Grants ability to validate deals, mark deals as executed, and modify system configurations like pricing, tariffs, and rates. Mid Office users maintain core system operations.
- **Back Office**: Grants read-only access to executed deals and their associated data, without modification capabilities. Back Office users can view but not edit completed transactions.
- **Read Only**: Grants read-only access to view data across the entire system, without the ability to modify any settings or data.

### Example of Permissions:

- A user with the **User** role can perform trading functions, but if they only have **Read Only** permissions, they will not be able to modify trading data or settings.
- Users with **Admin** permissions have full access across the system.

## Managing Roles and Permissions

Roles and permissions can be managed via the Flux OS dashboard. To assign or modify roles, navigate to the **Organization** section within your dashboard. Permissions are assigned at the lowest scope during onboarding and may be adjusted to the desired access level required by a organization's admin.
