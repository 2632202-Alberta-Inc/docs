## Overview

To authenticate your API requests, the Flux OS API requires two headers: `x-api-key` and `x-user-id`. You can generate your keys in the [app settings](https://www.flux-os.com/app/settings) view in your dashboard.

## Roles

Roles in Flux OS define a userâ€™s function within your organization in the public directory. A user can have more than one role, allowing for flexibility depending on their job function and the organization's structure.

## Permissions

Permissions control what a user can do within Flux OS, regardless of their role. Currently, there are five permission levels:

* **Admin**: Grants full access to manage settings, data, and system configurations. Admins can also modify roles and permissions.

* **Front Office**: Grants ability to create and modify deals until execution, enter temporary pricing and rates, and access sandbox environments. Front Office users can initiate but not finalize transactions.

* **Mid Office**: Grants ability to validate deals, mark deals as executed, and modify system configurations like pricing, tariffs, and rates. Mid Office users maintain core system operations.

* **Back Office**: Grants read-only access to executed deals and their associated data, without modification capabilities. Back Office users can view but not edit completed transactions.

* **Read Only**: Grants read-only access to view data across the entire system, without the ability to modify any settings or data.

### Example of Permissions:

* A user with the **User** role can perform trading functions, but if they only have **Read Only** permissions, they will not be able to modify trading data or settings.

* Users with **Admin** permissions have full access across the system.

## Managing Roles and Permissions

Roles and permissions can be managed via the Flux OS dashboard. To assign or modify roles, navigate to the **Organization** section within your dashboard. Permissions are assigned at the lowest scope during onboarding and may be adjusted to the desired access level required by a organization's admin.
