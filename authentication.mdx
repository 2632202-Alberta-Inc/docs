## Authentication

The Flux OS API requires two headers for authentication: `x-api-key` and `x-user-id`. These headers ensure that each request is securely authenticated.

- **x-api-key**: Your API key, which is generated in the [App Settings](https://dashboard.flux-os.com/settings).
- **x-user-id**: The user ID associated with your account.

Hereâ€™s an example Python request using both headers:

```python
import requests

base_url = "https://v1.api.flux-os.com"
path = "/ping"

headers = {
    "x-api-key": "YOUR_API_KEY",
    "x-user-id": "YOUR_USER_ID"
}

response = requests.get(base_url + path, headers=headers)

print(response.status_code)
print(response.json())
